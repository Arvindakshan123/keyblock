# keyblock
Our project name is KEYBLOCK- a Non-Keylogabble keyborad which does not record or store any keystrokes which is typed by the user.
The project is basically done using JAVA codes and have also developed an application for it using Android Studio.
The application is designed in such a way that it's user friendly and protects for privacy issues.
Since nowadays people are very clever and harm us digitally and technically , we need to boost up ourselves to protect oursleves from it.
So , a keybord like we designed is needed in today's generation to stop the world from harming others privacy digitally CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability).
